# LuaTeX

Here's the zip file to make the book with LuaTeX. If you don't have TeX installed, you can use <a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>; it doens't require you to install anything. Make sure to <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Changing_compiler">change the compiler to LuaTeX</a> :).
